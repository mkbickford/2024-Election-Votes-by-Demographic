# 2024-Election-Votes-by-Demographic

This repository provides helpful predictions on voter turnout and candidate selection for the 2024 U.S. presidential election. This data is based on results from the 2020 U.S. elections and observes voter turnout by age and gender and candidate selection by age, gender, race, religion, and yearly salary.

Voter turnout analysis predicts that older voters of both gender groups are far more likely to vote than their younger counterparts. Turnout rates among voters aged 18 to 30 were consistently less than 50%.

Candidate selection predictions are as follows:
- Younger voters are 15-20% more likely to vote for Biden than Trump and older voters are slightly more likely to favor Trump over Biden
- Lower income households (<$100,000) are more likely to vote for Biden than Trump, higher income households ($200,000+) are equally likely to vote for either     candidate, and Americans making between $100,000 and $200,000 per year are more likely to vote for Trump
- Women are more likely to vote for Biden, while men are more likely to vote for Trump
- White voters are more likely to vote for Trump; non-white voters are more likely to vote for Biden
- Christians are more likely to vote for Trump, while members of all other major religious groups and those unaffiliated are more likely to vote for Biden
